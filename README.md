## About Me
My name is Jaylen, I'm 23 years old, and live in the state of Wyoming in the USA. I currently work as a Network Administator, and I like to learn web app development, sing, and play video games on my off time.
I have been studying web development by myself off and on since high school, but now I'm taking serious interest as my company could benefit from custom-made web applications to help with our documentation and overall ease of life within company operations.

## About This Project
This is the first iteration of my personal webpage. 
I am currently learning Svelte/SvelteKit, and am looking to re-build/re-design my page based on the Svelte framework.
